# CS 472/572:  Distributed Databases and Big Data 

[Overview](./README.md) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Syllabus](./syllabus.md)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Schedule](./schedule.md)

## Learning Objectives
In this course, students will learn to design and build large-scale distributed databases, database fragmentation, data replication, data security, and concurrency. A significant part of the course will be hands-on labs featuring MongoDB (creating and managing collections, writing queries, replication, PyMongo, etc.). In addition, students will learn about Big Data storage, processing and analysis, web data handling, and CDN. Finally, students will gain hands-on experience in Spark 3 using Databricks. 

Labs will cover MongoDB (for distributed databases/NoSQL) and Spark (for Big Data).
