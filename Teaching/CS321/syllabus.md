## Data collection statement

As part of the regular ABET accreditation process for the undergraduate
programs in computer and electrical engineering, we will be collecting samples
of students' work in each of our undergraduate classes.  As a result, some of
your labs/homeworks/exams may be photocopied/scanned and saved to present to
the ABET evaluators who visit next fall.
